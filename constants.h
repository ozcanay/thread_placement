// llc lookups

// Definition: Counts the number of times the LLC was accessed - this includes code,
// data, prefetches and hints coming from L2. This has numerous filters available. Note
// the non-standard filtering equation. This event will count requests that lookup the
// cache multiple times with multiple increments. One must **************ALWAYS************** set umask bit 0
// AND SELECT A STATE OR STATES TO MATCH. --> Otherwise, the event will count nothing. <-- CHA-
// Filter0[24:21,17] bits correspond to [FMESI] state.
// â€¢ NOTE: ***Bit 0 of the umask must ***ALWAYS*** be set for this event***. This allows us to match
// against a given state (or states) as programmed in the Cn_MSR_PMON_BOX_FIL-
// TER0.state field bitmask. 0 = I (miss), 4 = S, 5 = E, 6 = M, 7 = F. For example, if
// you wanted to monitor F and S hits, you could set 00001001b in the 8-bit state field.
// To monitor any lookup, set the field to 0x1F. Extra note - it may be a little confusing
// for customers of earlier products. With the CBo and HA functionality combined, it's
// possible to also measure Snoop Filter lookups with bits 1-3 of the FILTER0.state field
